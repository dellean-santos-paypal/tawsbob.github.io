As an experienced frontend specialist with a passion for technology, I've been working in the industry since 2009, honing my skills and developing my expertise in building cutting-edge applications. Over the years, I've worked with some of the top 10 best startups in the Brazilian market, delivering innovative solutions that have made a real impact in the industry. With my degree in Graphic Designer and my self-taught programming skills since the age of 14, I bring a unique perspective to software engineering that combines design sensibilities with technical know-how.

  

In my current role as a Senior Software Engineer, I specialize in building software as a service (SaaS) products using the latest technologies, including React and Node.js. I have extensive experience with popular frontend frameworks like Next.js, as well as all environment javascript vanila (es5, es6), and have used my skills to create powerful APIs with popular Node.js libraries like Express, Nest.js, and LoopBack. Additionally, I have experience creating scrape bots, working with AWS cloud, and using git and CI/CD tools to streamline the development process.

  

As an accomplished software engineer, I've not only built great products but also shared my knowledge with the next generation of Brazilian students. I've had the opportunity to teach about frontend and backend development, covering topics ranging from functional and Object Oriented Programming to the latest trends in the industry. With my extensive experience and passion for technology, I'm excited to take on new challenges and make meaningful contributions to any team.
